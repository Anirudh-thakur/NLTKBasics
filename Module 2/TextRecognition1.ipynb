    "Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.\n",
    "It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
    "Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",
    "Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language.\n",
    "Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020.\n",
    "Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.\n",
    "With Python 2's end-of-life (and pip having dropped support in 2021), only Python 3.6.x and later are supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not restricted to 64-bit Windows).\n",
